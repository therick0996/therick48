A PCB I made for funsies

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):  

    make therick48:default

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/make_instructions.html) for more information.  
First pass at adding support for the 4x4 keyboard. Compiles but completely untested. Intended to kick-start development.
